[Dataset link](http://nil.fdi.ucm.es/?q=node/639)

The SNPPhenA corpus consists of medical and biological texts annotated for snp-phenotype associations, negation, modality markers and degree of confidence of associations. This was done to allow a comparison between the development of systems for association extraction as well as the degree of confidence and strength of associations.
